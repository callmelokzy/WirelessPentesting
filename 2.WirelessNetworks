What is Wireless Infrastructure?
Wireless infrastructure is the integration of technology, software, support, security measures, and devices for the management and delivery of wireless communications.

WIRELESS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS
  So, what is a wireless distribution system? Essentially, it is an infrastructure that facilitates the expansion of a wireless network through the 
  need for multiple industrial access points without requiring any wiring to link them together. Using WDS, you can easily link together two or more 
  wireless access points to expand the range of a wireless network without using a traditional wire backbone Ethernet connection that is typically used 
  to link them. Ultimately, WDS can provide two different modes of wireless connectivity between access points: wireless bridging and wireless repeating.
      ● Wireless Bridging: wireless bridging involves connecting two wireless access points together so that they can communicate exclusively with each other. 
        Essentially, the wireless bridge acts as a client and logs into the primary router to gain an internet connection. Upon doing so, the bridge passes 
        the connection along to the other connected devices. This mode of connectivity does not allow wireless clients or stations (STAs) - such as laptops, PDA, 
        wireless phones, and other devices with the capability to use the 802.11 protocol - to achieve access.
      ● Wireless Repeating: wireless repeating allows access points to communicate with one another as well as with wireless STAs. Essentially, 
        the existing signal from a wireless router or access point is taken and re-broadcasted to create a second network.

What is ad-hoc network?
  Ad hoc networks are mostly wireless local area networks (LANs). The devices communicate with each other directly instead of relying on a base station 
  or access points as in wireless LANs for data transfer co-ordination. Each device participates in routing activity, by determining the route using the 
  routing algorithm and forwarding data to other devices via this route. Ad Hoc Wireless Network Limitations
  For file and printer sharing, all users need to be in the same workgroup, or if one computer is joined to a domain, the other users must have accounts 
  on that computer to access shared items. Other limitations of ad hoc wireless networking include the lack of security and a slow data rate. 
  Ad hoc mode offers minimal security; if attackers come within range of your ad hoc network, they won't have any trouble connecting.

Applications of Ad Hoc Networks
  Ad hoc networks serve various purposes, including:
  Gives military units access to all soldiers, vehicles, and headquarters
  Allows users to create personal area networks (PANs) or short-range local networks that connects several nodes
  Provides emergency responders to send signals during crises
  Useful in monitoring patients
  Helps check for weather conditions, forest fires, tsunamis, and other natural or man-made disasters

What is a MESH NETWORK?

  WiFi mesh networks use multiple nodes that communicate with each other to share a wireless connection within a larger area. 
  One node acts as your main mesh WiFi router. It connects to your internet modem or wireless gateway (a combination of a wireless router and a modem). 
  A modem is a device that accesses the internet. When routers or switches are connected to the modem, they are able to tap into the internet and 
  broadcast it to give your connected devices WiFi access. As well as the main node, you will have additional nodes that will need to be set up around 
  your home to improve the WiFi signal and eliminate dead spots. The most amazing thing about mesh networks is that they are truly wireless!
  The node connected to the modem wirelessly shares its internet connection with all the other nodes within its range. Those nodes wirelessly share 
  their internet connection with the nodes within their range. It's almost like having multiple WiFi routers in your home, but they share one seamless WiFi network. 
  As a result, having multiple nodes increases the wireless internet coverage throughout your home.

WIFI DIRECT?
  Wi-Fi Direct enables mobile phones, cameras, printers, PCs, and gaming devices to create their own Wi-Fi networks without an internet connection. 
  Connect other Wi-Fi Direct devices to each other to transfer or display content, play games, and share applications quickly and easily through device settings. 
  Devices can make a one-to-one connection, or a group of several devices can connect simultaneously. Because there is no need for an access point or 
  internet connection, Wi-Fi Direct networks go wherever devices go. Wi-Fi Direct connections between devices are the underlying technology for many applications,
  including Miracast®. Thousands of devices such as smartphones, cameras, printers, televisions, PCs, and gaming devices are already certified.

Wireless interface in Monitor Mode?
  In Monitor mode, your card can listen to every packets that's around us. By default, the mode of wireless devices is set to "Managed" that means our 
  wireless device will only capture packets that have our device's MAC address as the destination MAC. It will only capture packets that are actually directly 
  to my Kali machine.
  But we want to capture all the packets that are within our range even if the destination MAC is not our MAC or even without knowing the password of the target device.
  To do this, we need to set the mode as Monitor mode.
