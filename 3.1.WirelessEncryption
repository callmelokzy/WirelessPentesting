DAY 3: WIRELESS PENTESTING (WiFi Encryption PART1) 20/1/2023
____________________________________________________________________


[+] Open Wireless Networks?
An open wireless network is a type of wireless network that does not have any security measures in place to protect it from unauthorized access.
This means that anyone within range of the network can connect to it and potentially access or use the network’s resources without permission. 
Open wireless networks are also known as “unsecured” or “unprotected” wireless networks.

Examples of open wireless networks include:
- A coffee shop or restaurant that offers free Wi-Fi to customers without requiring a password or login
- A residential wireless router that has not been configured with a password or encryption
- A public wireless network at a hotel, airport, or other location that does not require a password or login
- A wireless network created by a business that does not have any security measures in place, such as a wireless access point that is not 
  configured with a password or encryption.
- Open wireless networks can be a security risk as they provide a potential point of entry for hackers and malicious actors, who can use the network 
  to gain access to sensitive information or launch attacks on other devices on the network.

*It’s worth noting that open wireless networks can still be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, where a malicious actor intercepts communications between the user and the network and can steal personal information, so even if they are free to connect and use, it’s not recommended to send sensitive information or access sensitive accounts while connected to them.

[+] Wired Equivalent Privacy?

Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is a security protocol that was developed to provide a wired equivalent level of security for wireless networks.
It was the first security protocol for wireless networks, and was widely used in the early days of wireless networking.
WEP uses a shared key for encryption, which is a password that is used to encrypt and decrypt data.
The shared key is typically entered into both the wireless access point and the client devices that connect to the network.
WEP uses a symmetric encryption algorithm (A symmetric encryption algorithm is a type of encryption where the same key is used for both encrypting 
and decrypting data.) called RC4 to encrypt data. The encryption keys used by WEP are typically 40 or 104 bits in length.


--> RC4 Algorithm
    — — — — — — — 

- RC4 (also known as Rivest Cipher 4) is a symmetric key stream cipher that was widely used in wireless networks, and other applications.
- RC4 works by generating a stream of pseudo-random bytes, which are then combined with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext. 
  The stream of bytes is generated using a secret key, which is shared between the sender and the receiver. The receiver can then use the same key 
  to regenerate the stream of bytes and decrypt the ciphertext.
- RC4 uses the following steps to encrypt and decrypt data:

      Initialisation: 
                    The algorithm is initialised with a secret key, which is used to generate a permutation of all possible bytes (from 0 to 255).
      Key-Scheduling Algorithm (KSA): 
                    The key-scheduling algorithm is used to create a permutation of the bytes based on the secret key. It uses the key to initialise 
                    a 256-byte state array S.
      Pseudo-Random Generation Algorithm (PRGA): 
                    The pseudo-random generation algorithm generates a stream of bytes based on the state array S. The stream of bytes is combined 
                    with the plain-text to produce the cipher-text.
      Encryption: 
                    The plain-text is combined with the stream of bytes (generated by PRGA) using a bitwise exclusive-or (XOR) operation. 
                    This produces the ciphertext.
      Decryption: 
                    The ciphertext is combined with the same stream of bytes (generated by PRGA) using a bitwise exclusive-or (XOR) operation. 
                    This produces the original plaintext.



--> WEP Authentication?
    — — — — — — — — — — 

In WEP there are two types of authentication:

- 1. Open System Authentication: This type of authentication does not require any type of identification or password. Any device can connect to the network without any validation.
- 2. Shared Key Authentication: This type of authentication requires a device to prove that it knows the shared key by encrypting a challenge text sent by the access point using the shared key.

      Let me explain the process of shared key authentication in more detail:

      1. The client device, such as a laptop or smartphone, attempts to connect to the wireless network.
      2. The access point (AP), which controls access to the network, sends an unencrypted challenge text to the client. This challenge text is a random string of characters.
      3. The client receives the challenge text and uses the shared key (the password) to encrypt the challenge text. The encryption algorithm used is typically RC4.
      4. The client then sends the encrypted challenge text back to the AP.
      5. The AP receives the encrypted challenge text and compares it to the original challenge text that it sent. If the two match, it means that the client has the correct shared key, and the client is authenticated and allowed to access the network.
      6. Once the client is authenticated, it can then send and receive data on the network.
