1. IEEE 802.11?
----------------
IEEE 802.11 standard, popularly known as Wi-Fi, lays down the architecture and specifications of wireless LANs (WLANs). 
Wi-Fi or WLAN uses high-frequency radio waves (2.4 and 5 GHz) .The core of Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)system is known as the Access Point, AP. 
The Wi-Fi access point is essentially the base station that communicates with the Wi-Fi enabled devices .
Wi-Fi channel : is the frequency at which your router sends out the information to your device. 
There will typically be a variety of different Wi-Fi channel that can be used. The Wi-Fi access point or Wi-Fi router will generally select the optimum channel to be used by itself.

  [+] Channel width: basically controls how broad the signal is for transferring data. Think of it like a highway. 
      The wider the road, the more traffic (data) can pass through. When choosing the channel bandwidth for a wifi network, 
      the only thing to consider is that the data rate depends on the channel bandwidth. The transfer rate will be as high as the channel bandwidth. 
      We commonly have three options to choose from that are 20MHz, 40MHz, and 80MHz.

  [+] Modulation: The carrier wave used by radio frequency (RF) transmissions doesn't carry much information itself. To include speech or data, 
      another wave has to be superimposed on the carrier wave, thus changing the shape of the carrier wave. The process of doing so is called modulation.
      
In general, the 2.4GHz band operates on channels 8–13, while the 5GHz band uses channels 35–165.
To make Wi-Fi AP secure from unauthorized access , a password is normally required to be able to log on/connect to the access point.

It is possible to use a very wide bandwidth to enable high throughput data, and also good re-use of the spectrum is possible.

3. Antenna Diversity vs MIMO
----------------------------
Antenna diversity and MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) are two technology concepts frequently used in mobile communications. 
Antenna diversity is a more fundamental concept, whereas MIMO is an antenna technology that benefits from antenna diversity.

  Antenna Diversity
      Antenna diversity, also known as space diversity or spatial diversity, is any one of several wireless diversity schemes that uses two or more 
      antennas to improve the quality and reliability of a wireless link. It involves using multiple antennas primarily at the receiver of a base station 
      (cell tower) so that signals coming from different directions get a better chance to be picked up by the receiver. Here the transmitter transmits same data (as multiple copies) 
      to each antenna in receiver side, that there is always the possibility of the packet receiving in the receiver side ,and this ensure the reliability of the wireless link.
      
        1. Selection diversity: 
                among the multiple copies of same data received in the antennas , the receiver only accept best data 
                i.e data with highest SNR(signal-to-noise-ratio)
        2. Feedback/scanning Diversity: 
                the receiver sets a threshold signal value for the data to be accepted, here each antenna is scanned in a 
                particular sequence. While these antennas are being scanned if either one of the antenna is found signal which is greater 
                than the threshold value then that data is taken by the receiver.

  MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output)
    MIMO or Multiple Input Multiple Output is an antenna technology that uses multiple antenna elements at the transmitter and receiver to improve 
    radio signal quality and data rates. In MIMO, the transmitter antenna has multiple antenna elements, e.g. 2, 4, 8 or more, which transmit multiple 
    signal data streams to the receiver. The receiver antenna also has a number of antenna elements to receive the data streams.
    The configuration of the MIMO system is defined by the number of antenna elements at the transmitter and receiver. For example, 
    4G LTE-Advanced networks have a configuration of 8×8 for the downlink, which means eight antenna elements at the transmitter and another eight 
    at the receiver side when sending the signal from the base station to the mobile phone. LTE-Advanced networks use a lower configuration for the 
    uplink with four antenna elements at the transmitter and four at the receiver (4×4) when sending the signal from the mobile phone back to the base station.
    MIMO benefits from spatial diversity at both the transmitter and the receiver sides. 4G LTE and 5G NR networks employ MIMO technology due to the spatial 
    multiplexing capability.
